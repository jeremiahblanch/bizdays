# BusinessDayCounter

To set up, please run `npm install` followed by `npm run init` which sets up ts-jest.

Then you can run the tests with `npm run test`.

The tests contains all the test values and expected results from the challenge.

I did this without using any third party libraries for the date manipulations.
If third-party libaries were used, I would probably use date-fns[https://date-fns.org/]
I wrote a comment within BusinessDayCounter.class.ts explaining how the logic might be changed to use date-fns.
